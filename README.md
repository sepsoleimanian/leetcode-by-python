# LeetCode Python Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode Python solutions repository! ðŸš€

While on my journey to improve my understanding of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**, I am tackling problems on LeetCode and documenting my solutions here. This repository is a collection of Python implementations for various LeetCode challenges that I solve along the way.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to:

- **Sharpen my problem-solving skills** in DSA.
- **Practice Python** while implementing efficient algorithms.
- **Track my progress** over time.

You may notice that some of the solutions here might seem simple. Thatâ€™s because I am focusing on getting better, reinforcing foundational concepts, and learning how to approach problems systematically.

Please note that:

- These are my personal solutions and may not always be the most optimized.
- This repository is a work in progress as I continue to learn and solve more problems.
- Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, or suggest improvements!

## Contributing

If you have any feedback, suggestions, or optimizations to propose, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Thanks for stopping by, and happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
